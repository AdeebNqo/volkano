#Volkano

Application for streaming videos from a nmdc hub. Does not support the adc protocol.

Currently testing it on

    - opendchub running on port 1200 (Ubuntu 12.10)
    - PtokaX running on port 411 (Windows 7)
    
Please note that there is a 30 second delay in retrieving response from hub so it might be a little slow

#TODO

- [X] Connect to a nmdc hub
- [ ] Get list of files
- [ ] Index files in search server
- [ ] design ui
- [ ] retrieve metadata
- [ ] Connect UI and streaming
